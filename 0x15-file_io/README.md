File I/O is an essential part of any programming language that deals with external data. C, being a low-level programming language, provides a set of functions to perform file operations. These functions are part of the C Standard Library and can be used to read from and write to files on the computer's file system.

Understanding file I/O is crucial for any programmer who needs to create or manipulate files in their programs. It allows for the efficient storage and retrieval of data from files, making it possible to work with large amounts of data that would otherwise be impossible to manage in memory.

In this section of the README file, we will cover the basic file I/O operations in C, including opening and closing files, reading from and writing to files, and moving the file pointer. We will also provide examples of how to use these functions to perform various file operations.
