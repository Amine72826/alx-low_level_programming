Bit manipulation refers to the process of manipulating individual bits, the smallest unit of data, within a binary number. This technique is often used in computer programming to perform operations on binary data more efficiently and to optimize memory usage. Bit manipulation can be used to perform tasks such as setting or clearing individual bits, checking the value of a bit, shifting bits left or right, and performing bitwise operations like AND, OR, and XOR. Understanding bit manipulation is an important skill for any programmer working with low-level languages or dealing with binary data.
